    "Visapur Fort, located near Lonavala in the Pune district, is a twin fort of Lohagad and one of the most popular trekking destinations in Maharashtra. Built during the early 18th century, this fort stands taller than its twin and offers sweeping views of the surrounding valleys and hills.",
    "Constructed by Balaji Vishwanath, the first Peshwa of the Maratha Empire, Visapur served as a watchtower fort due to its strategic location. Today, it attracts trekkers, history buffs, and photographers for its scenic beauty and ancient ruins."
