  "overview": [
    "The Kalaram Temple, located in Panchavati, Nashik, is one of the most revered temples dedicated to Lord Rama. Built in black stone, it derives its name 'Kalaram' meaning 'Black Rama' from the striking black idol of Lord Rama housed within.",
    "This temple holds immense spiritual and historical importance as it stands close to sites associated with Lord Rama’s exile described in the Ramayana. It was constructed in the 18th century by Sardar Rangarao Odhekar after he dreamt of the idol being found in the Godavari River.",
    "Kalaram Temple also played a significant role in India’s social reform history — Dr. B. R. Ambedkar led a major Dalit temple entry movement here in 1930, marking it as both a religious and social landmark."
