    "The Jyotiba Temple, located near Wadi Ratnagiri in Kolhapur district, is one of Maharashtra’s most revered pilgrimage sites dedicated to Lord Jyotiba — an incarnation of Lord Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma. It is believed that Lord Jyotiba helped Goddess Mahalaxmi in her battle against demons, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil.",
