    "The Girijatmaj Temple at Lenyadri, near Junnar in Pune district, is one of the eight revered Ashtavinayak Temples of Maharashtra. This temple holds a unique place as it is carved into a mountain cave complex and symbolizes divine motherhood.",
    "According to legend, Goddess Parvati performed penance here and was blessed with Lord Ganesha as her son—hence the name ‘Girijatmaj’, meaning ‘Son of the Mountain Goddess’.",
    "The temple lies in the 7th cave of the Lenyadri hill, part of 30 Buddhist rock-cut caves, blending Hindu and Buddhist architectural influences. Reaching the shrine requires climbing 283 stone steps, making it a physically and spiritually uplifting experience."
