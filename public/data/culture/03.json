    "Dashavatar is an 800-year-old folk theatre form indigenous to the Sindhudurg district of Konkan. As the name suggests, it dramatizes the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu, blending mythology with sharp social commentary.",
    "Performed without a written script, the plays rely heavily on the improvisation and wit of the actors. The performance traditionally begins at midnight and continues until dawn, serving as both entertainment and moral education for the village community."
