  "overview": [
    "Dahi Handi is one of Maharashtra’s most electrifying festivals, celebrated on the day after Janmashtami (the birth of Lord Krishna). It reenacts the childhood legend of 'Maakhan Chor' (Butter Thief) Krishna, who would form human pyramids with his friends to steal curd from high-hanging pots.",
    "Today, this tradition has evolved into a massive spectator sport where 'Govinda Pathaks' (teams) compete to break earthen pots suspended 30-40 feet in the air, winning huge cash prizes and the adoration of thousands."
