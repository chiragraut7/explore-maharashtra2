  "overview": [
    "Ganesh Chaturthi is the soul of Maharashtra. For 10 days, the entire state stops to celebrate the homecoming of Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles. While it is a religious festival, it is also a massive social event that unites people across all castes and communities.",
    "Historically popularized by Lokmanya Tilak to unite Indians against British rule, the festival today is a spectacle of art, music, and devotion, culminating in the emotional 'Visarjan' (immersion) where millions bid farewell to their beloved deity."
