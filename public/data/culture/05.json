    "Gudi Padwa marks the beginning of the New Year for Maharashtrians and Hindus across the Deccan region. It falls on the first day of the Chaitra month, symbolizing the arrival of spring and the harvest of rabi crops.",
    "According to mythology, it is believed that Lord Brahma created the universe on this day. Families hoist a 'Gudi' (victory flag) outside their windows—a bamboo staff topped with a bright cloth, neem leaves, and a copper pot—to invite prosperity and ward off evil."
