  "overview": [
    "Bharud is a unique devotional folk art of Maharashtra that blends spiritual wisdom with drama, humor, and song. Popularized by the 16th-century saint Sant Eknath, it was designed to bring the complex philosophy of the Vedas to the common man in a language they understood.",
    "A typical Bharud performance features a single performer (the Bharudkar) who assumes various roles—an astrologer, a housewife, or a unhappy soul—using satire and wit to deliver profound moral messages about shedding ego and finding God."
